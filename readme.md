## Configuration

- **Resume Attachment**:  
  Place your resume file (e.g., `Resume_Debasish_Research.pdf`) in the project directory. Update the file path in the code if necessary.

- **Email Configuration**:  
  Ensure your email credentials (`EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS`) are correct and set securely as environment variables.

- **AI API Key**:  
  Set the `AI_API_KEY` environment variable with your Google Generative AI API key.

## Troubleshooting

- **Flask Server Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and environment variables are correctly set.
- **Email Sending Issues**: Check your email credentials and verify that your email provider allows access to less secure apps or has an app-specific password feature.
- **AI Model Errors**: Ensure the AI API key is valid and the `google-generativeai` library is properly installed.
